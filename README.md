This project is a GUI-based file explorer. Examples would include File Explorer on Windows, Finder on macOS, and Nautilus on Ubuntu.

**Description**
- It can be used via a pointing device like a mouse or trackpad, with keyboard shortcuts as well (e.g. the Delete key would delete a file).
- It will be a lot more user friendly due to not having to memorize commands like ls, rm, mkdir, etc.
- Primary mouse click to select/highlight a file
- Double click to execute a file with the appropriate program for the file extension (further explained in the technical design section)
- Secondary mouse click to bring up additional actions (such as to delete, rename, or view the properties of a file)
- Click and drag to select multiple files at once

**Instructions**
- STUFF

**Known Bugs**
