- Get every file in the current working directory (in this case, the repo folder) into a string array
- Fix proposal to switch to using opendir() and readdir() rather than popen() with ls
- Obtain the file extension of a file
- Run files with the appropriate program given an extension
- Put necessary data like the permissions and the size in bytes into a struct that can be easily accessed
- Note: do not use the system() call after forking a child - for some reason it causes a fork bomb

- Comments on whatever has been done so far
- Add to file properties struct whether or not smth in a directory is a file or folder
- Basic file operations: create untitled document, create new folder, rename stuff, delete stuff
