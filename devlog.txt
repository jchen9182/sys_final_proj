- Proposal
  - Timeline of project
  - apt instructions for GTK+ on Ubuntu

[2019-12-30] Kevin Li
- Get every file in the current working directory (in this case, the repo folder) into a string array
- Fix proposal to switch to using opendir() and readdir() rather than popen() with ls
- Obtain the file extension of a file
- Run files with the appropriate program given an extension
- Put necessary data like the permissions and the size in bytes into a struct that can be easily accessed
- Note: do not use the system() call after forking a child - for some reason it causes a fork bomb

[2019-12-31] Kevin Li
- Comments on whatever has been done so far
- Add to file properties struct whether or not smth in a directory is a file or folder
- Basic file operations: create untitled document, create new folder, rename stuff, delete stuff

[2020-01-05] Kevin Li
- Basic GTK+ stuff
- Experimenting with showing stuff on screen

[2020-01-13] Samuel Fang
- Comment on cd operation
- Basic cd operations: enter directory, double click, back

[2020-01-13] Kevin Li
- makefile for easy running of the program
- Grid layout established for all files in the folder
  - Still need to limit the size of labels somehow
- Show cwd in the title bar

[2020-01-14] Kevin Li
- Show a menu upon right clicking a file
  - Open file (working)
  - Remove file (not yet implemented)
  - Rename file (not yet implemented)

[2020-01-15] Samuel Fang and Justin Chen
- Fixed get properties and added get directory

[2020-01-15] Kevin Li
- Truncate file names if too long
- Delete file (after right clicking a file) [GRID DOES NOT SHIFT LEFT]
  - Also get rid of the label beneath
- There is some weird GTK related bug that I can't seem to diagnose the cause of. All I know is that it happens on the school computers and not on my own PC.

[2020-01-16] Kevin Li
- Fixed the GTK issue by setting the MIN_VERSION flag or whatever to a newer version when compiling
- Double click a file to open a file

[2020-01-17] Samuel Fang
- Fixed README.md

[2020-01-17] Kevin Li
- I seriously hope this fixed the memory corruption issue.
  - Changed getfiles() to malloc an array of char pointers and individually malloc-ed space for each file (MAX_FILE_LEN).
  - Previously, I just malloc-ed 100 * MAX_FILE_LEN once at the beginning of the function.
  - This probably meant that the memory the strings initially took up wasn't protected and was "taken over" by an abundance of GTK widgets.
  - Won't know if this issue is 100% fixed until I can test this on the school computers.

[2019-01-18] Kevin Li
- Homogeneous spacing for the grid
- Popover after clicking "Rename" done
  - Bolding for the text in the popover
- Rename files/folders
  - Error checking so that you cannot have duplicate files/folders
  - Pre-fill existing file's name so you don't have to retype the whole thing in case you only want to make a minor adjustment
